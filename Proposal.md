## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a comprehensive database of bitcoin indicators and apply machine learning techniques to gain a better understanding of the relationships between different indicators and price movements. This information can then be used to develop more effective trading strategies, which can help traders make more informed decisions and potentially improve their returns. 

## Background
The use of technical indicators is a common practice among traders in the cryptocurrency market, with the goal of identifying patterns and trends in price movements. It is difficult to determine which indicators perform useful in trading decisions. An indiccators database is a convieniant way providing clean and direct data to users who will apply the machine learning methods. Machine learning techniques, such as feature importance algorithms, can help identify the indicators that have the greatest impact on bitcoin's price movements.

## Project Implementation

### 1.  Building a [[crypto indicators]] database:
-   Collect 5 years historical data for bitcoin asset from Tokenmatric 
-   Build the indicators with all parmeters by using Ta-lib (e.g. moving averages, relative strength    index, etc).
-   Store the data in a structured format, to facilitate querying and analysis.
-   Update the documentation
- --1. Definition of indicators
- --2. Indicators calculation
- --3. Example

### 2.  Applying machine learning to analyze feature importance:
-  Visualize and analyze the feature importance of the indicators to understand the result.
-  Use the information to develop a crypto trading strategy that focuses on the most important indicators.
-  Continuously monitor and update the model to adapt to changing market conditions.
